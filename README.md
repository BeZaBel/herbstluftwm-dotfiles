## Dotfiles

A simple Herbstluftwm rice.
Config for herbstluft is the default with some custom keybinds. The polybar config is basically just [this](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes/tree/master/polybar-6) but with some custom modifications (config-t7.ini).

#### Stuff

- Firefox with HNTP for the newtab.
- Alacritty for terminal (gotta go fast)
- Nemo because I like panes in a GTK3 file browser
- feh for simplicity
- Polybar because ease of use
- Cantata for music
- Cava for flexing
- Rofi as menu (also, the polybar [config](https://github.co
    m/adi1090x/polybar-themes/tree/master/polybar-6) is built around Rofi)
